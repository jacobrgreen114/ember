# Ember
Ember is a quick and useful tool to turn binary files into C/C++ arrays.

## Inspiration
I started working on my own graphics and ui libraries.
During development I quickly realized that I had to manage a lot of files (images, shaders, etc.) during building.
The vision for Ember is to make working with non-source files easier.

## CMake Integration
CMake integration is currently not implemented.

## Development
Ember is currently in very early stages of development and highly likely to change.
